=head1 NAME

Data::Tree::Describe - Create annotated versions of complex data trees

=head1 WARNING

This module is in active development and has been uploaded simply as part of a 
standard and automated release procedure.

If you have any ideas for what would be helpful to implement, please contact the 
author!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for comment Small howto

    use Data::Tree::Describe;

    my $data_object = {test=>['some','stuff']};

    my $described_tree = Data::Tree::Describe->new($data_object);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for comment The module's description.

This module was originally developed for data trees or objects created from 
json::maybexs, though it technically will work on any perl data tree.

The module is fairly heavy processing wise and recursively iterates through a 
tree determining the type for every node as well as other handy attributes such
as how many children are in any HASH or ARRAY type.

=head1 METHODS

Callable methods

=head2 new

Create a new annotated data tree

Takes 1 argument an $object

BEWARE large objects will take some time to be processed.

=cut

# Primary code block
sub new($class,$input = {}) {

    my $self = bless {
        source  =>  $input,
        paths   =>  []
    }, $class;

    $self->{tree} = $self->_digest($input);
    return $self; 
}

=head2 paths_list

Return a list of all paths in the format: [element,element,element],[element,element]

Of the list returned, the first element [0] will always have a blank 'child name'
as it is representative of the parent node.

=cut 

# Reverse this as due to the way the recursion works, the base element is
# returned first.
sub paths_list($self) {
    return reverse @{$self->{paths}};
}

=head2 extract

Return a block of data starting from the point specified.

Accepts 1 argument; the path in the format of a list ['some_node',3,'element']

If you pass a blank or undefined list to the function it will return the entire
tree, as it will presume you are selecting the root/base node.
